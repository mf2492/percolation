This program contains two program files: A4.py and percolate.py, as well as
supplmentary text files containing examples of grids. In order to run this
program, make sure that these two files are in the same folder directory since
percolate.py is an imported class in A4.py.


Running A4.py first prints out four sample cases of grids:
    1. no percolation (p=0)
    2. guaranteed percolation (p=1)
    3. the example given in the assignment directions
    4. a larger grid given 50% percolation probability.

The user will then be prompted to either read an existing text file or create
a new text file. The user can enter the probability factor and the size of the
grid. This runs on a loop until the user chooses to quit the simulation.
If the user chooses to create a grid, the text file will be created in the 
directory in which the program is located.
